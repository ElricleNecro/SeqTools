Installation
============

LazyProc can be installed from `PyPi <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/lproc>`_:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install lproc

but since it is still in its infancy, you may want to pull from the
`git repository <https://github.com/nlgranger/LazyProc.git>`_ instead:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install git+https://github.com/nlgranger/LazyProc.git

Or work with the sources directly:

   git clone https://github.com/nlgranger/LazyProc.git
